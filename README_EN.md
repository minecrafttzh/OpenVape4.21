# Vape 4.21 Product Recovery

A research-oriented recovery project for the Vape 4.21 Java layer and Windows x64 native bridge layer.

### It is NOT official Vape source code, an original release package, or a vendor-signed artifact, and it does not guarantee behavior identical to the original product.

> This project is intended for software recovery, compatibility analysis, and testing in self-owned environments. It should only be used in isolated instances that you own and are authorized to test, and you are responsible for verifying local laws, software licenses, and server rules.

## Minecraft Compatibility

| Minecraft | Vanilla | Forge | Fabric |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.7.10 | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 1.8.9 | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 1.12.2 | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 1.16.5 | | | |
| 1.21.11 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 26.2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Injection into Lunar Client and Badlion Client 1.8.9 instances is also supported.

Support for Minecraft 1.16.5 is poor; certain mappings, rendering, and module features may not function properly.

**For version 26.2, please inject after joining a server or singleplayer world.**

All target instances must use a 64-bit JVM.

## Requirements

Required only for compiling and verifying the Java layer:

- JDK 17, used as the Gradle toolchain; target output is compiled via `--release 8` by default
- Project-bundled Gradle Wrapper; build script strictly requires Gradle 8.8
- Internet connection with access to Maven Central and Gradle Plugin Portal

Required for building the native bundle:

- Windows x64
- Visual Studio 2022 C++ x64 toolchain and Windows SDK
- CMake 3.21 or higher
- A JDK containing JNI/JVMTI headers; JDK 8 is recommended when testing against 1.7.10, 1.8.9, and 1.12.2

## Quick Start

In PowerShell, navigate to the repository root directory:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat clean build verifyInjectionPayload
```

This command performs the following tasks:

1. Compiles the recovered source code and processes all resources.
2. Checks source count and remaining fatal CFR decompilation markers.
3. Generates the injection JAR containing runtime dependencies.
4. Confirms that the payload includes necessary packages and that all classes can be loaded by Java 8.

Main Java artifacts are located in `build/libs/`. To generate IntelliJ IDEA project configurations, run:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat idea
```

## Building Native Test Bundle

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat prepareInjectionBundle -PtargetRelease=8 `
  -PnativeJavaHome="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_301"
```

The complete test bundle outputs to `build/injection/`:

```text
Vape421Native.dll
Vape421Injector.exe
README.md
```

The DLL embeds the Java injection JAR as an `RCDATA` resource, so placing a payload separately is not required. The native bridge layer only implements interfaces recovered from the sample's nine-method `RegisterNatives` table; additional Java native declarations not registered in the sample will not be fabricated. For more details, see [`native/README.md`](native/README.md).

## Running in an Isolated Environment

After launching a supported Minecraft instance (including 1.21.11/26.2 Fabric) or Lunar Client instance using a 64-bit JVM, execute the following in `build/injection/`:

```powershell
.\Vape421Injector.exe <pid> .\Vape421Native.dll
```

The injector only performs `LoadLibraryW`. Once loaded, the DLL waits for the JVM and Minecraft `Client thread`, and loads the embedded JAR via its context ClassLoader. Fabric instances add the payload to the Knot ClassLoader via the Fabric Launcher API. Subsequently, the DLL registers nine native methods and calls `gg.vape.runtime.NativeBridge.start()`. Execution results are written to `vape421-native.log` in the same directory as the DLL.

## Common Verification Tasks

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.\gradlew.bat check` | Compile, source coverage, and recovery quality verification |
| `.\gradlew.bat injectionJar` | Build self-contained Java injection payload |
| `.\gradlew.bat verifyInjectionPayload` | Verify dependency integrity and Java 8 bytecode version |
| `.\gradlew.bat buildNative` | Build x64 DLL and injector |
| `.\gradlew.bat prepareInjectionBundle` | Assemble native bundle ready for isolated testing |
